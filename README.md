LGBinExtractor
==============

A tool for extracting bin firmware for LG Phones

READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
------------------------------
I am still busy setting everything up on my side and as you can see the 
main method is empty. The code works but I have yet to implement usage 
through the tool itself. So far I've used it by hardcoding the action. The
other tools that also extracts LG bin files is based on this and so far I don't
see that they read all the information from the file only the bare minimum to split
the file into the various partitions.

I can't say for certain if this will work with your phones firmware. See supported firmware list.
